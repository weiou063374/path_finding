This project is a library for hundreds of units to find path running on mobile phones.
The path finding library support static,dynamic obstacle avoidance behaviour,boids behaviour.
Besides,it supports data determination for frame synchronization.The library uses A star,
flow field algorithm and dynamic AABB tree for improving performance.The units find path looks
like StarCraft2 path finding mode with a local clear direction finding algorithm,and without dynamic 
force it looks like warcraft3 path finding mode.
